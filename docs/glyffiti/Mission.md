High-Level Overview
Glyffiti is a decentralized platform designed to empower artists by giving them true ownership of their creative work. Its core vision is to let creators publish their stories and art directly onto the blockchain, ensuring that their work remains indelible and censorship-resistant. Here’s how it helps artists:

Greater Earnings: Artists keep a much larger share (60% or more) of every dollar earned, freeing them from the traditional model where intermediaries take up to 80%.
Immutable Art: Once a work is published (e.g., a long-form story or art piece), it’s permanently recorded on the blockchain—free from digital landlords and censorship.
Low-Cost, High-Impact Posting: The cost to inscribe even lengthy works is extremely low (fractions of a cent), making it an economical way to archive and share art.
Empowering Communities: By leveraging a peer-to-peer network, the platform fosters a resilient ecosystem where users can rate, share, and tip, creating a vibrant and supportive creative community.
Medium-Level Technical Breakdown
Glyffiti is built as a modular and extensible system that combines modern blockchain technology with decentralized social features. Here’s a closer look at its main components and technologies:

Blockchain Integration (e.g., Solana):

Story Posting: The platform currently posts story chunks to Solana. Each piece of content is broken down into manageable, compressed chunks that are inscribed as transactions on the blockchain. This ensures data immutability and traceability.
Extensibility: While Solana is the current target, the design is blockchain-agnostic, allowing for future integration with other chains (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) to broaden reach and capabilities.
Mobile Application (React Native with TypeScript):

User Interface: A dedicated mobile app provides artists and readers with intuitive screens for writing, reading, and interacting with content.
Monetization Features: Artists can set monetization preferences including tipping (via Glyffiti tokens), subscriptions, and content sharing. These features are integrated into the user experience so that revenue streams are transparent and fair.
Wallet Integration: Secure wallet functionality lets users purchase tokens and manage their credentials, ensuring that transactions (tipping or subscriptions) are seamless and secure.
Backend Services (Python):

API & Blockchain Interactions: The backend handles user authentication, blockchain transactions, and AI translation services. It ensures that every story is correctly chunked, posted, and then reassembled for readers.
AI Translation: To cater to a global audience, the backend includes an AI-based translation service that dynamically renders content in the reader’s preferred language.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking & Social Features:

Social Interactions: A P2P layer facilitates direct interactions between users (comments, ratings, and content recommendations) without heavy reliance on centralized servers. This not only minimizes hosting costs but also strengthens community resilience.
ATprotocol Integration: With initial ATprotocol coding already in place, Glyffiti is moving toward a decentralized social media experience where manifests (or “glyph maps”) help users share and discover content in a trust-minimized manner.
Manifest Sharing: Manifests act as a map for content—providing metadata and quick discovery of stories. This enhances content discoverability and social sharing in the network.
Monetary Support and Karma System:

Revenue Distribution: The platform employs a split model where the artist gets the lion’s share (around 60%), and the remaining 40% is fairly distributed among government fees, support roles, platform costs, and a dynamic karma pool.
Karma System: Users earn karma points through interactions like sharing, commenting, and tipping. Higher karma not only indicates community trust but also translates into greater rewards from the karma pool—further incentivizing positive engagement.
