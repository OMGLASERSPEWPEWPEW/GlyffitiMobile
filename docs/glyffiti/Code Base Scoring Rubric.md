# Codebase Quality Scoring Rubric

## Core Quality Categories (1-100 scale)

### 1. **Architecture & Organization** 
*How well the codebase follows established patterns and separation of concerns*
- Clear module boundaries, proper layering (UI/Logic/Data)
- Consistent folder structure and naming conventions
- Appropriate use of design patterns
- Score 80+ = FAANG-level organization

### 2. **Code Duplication & DRY**
*Measures redundancy and adherence to Don't Repeat Yourself principles*
- Reusable components and utilities
- Abstraction of common patterns
- No copy-paste programming
- Score 80+ = Minimal duplication, excellent reuse

### 3. **Security Practices**
*Implementation of security best practices and vulnerability prevention*
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication/authorization
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Score 80+ = Production-ready security

### 4. **Maintainability & Readability**
*How easy it is for new developers to understand and modify the code*
- Clear, self-documenting code
- Consistent coding style
- Appropriate comments where needed
- Logical flow and structure
- Score 80+ = New devs productive within days

### 5. **Test Coverage & Quality**
*Comprehensiveness and effectiveness of testing strategy*
- Unit test coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Integration and E2E tests where appropriate
- Tests are meaningful, not just for coverage
- Test code quality matches production code
- Score 80+ = Comprehensive testing pyramid

### 6. **Documentation**
*Quality and completeness of technical documentation*
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation
- Architecture decisions documented
- Inline documentation for complex logic
- Score 80+ = Self-sufficient documentation

### 7. **Performance & Optimization**
*Efficiency of algorithms and resource usage*
- Appropriate algorithm choices (O notation)
- Efficient data structures
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Database query optimization
- Score 80+ = Production-scale performance

### 8. **Error Handling & Resilience**
*Robustness and graceful failure management*
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Proper exception handling
- Logging and monitoring hooks
- Graceful degradation
- Score 80+ = Production-grade reliability

### 9. **Dependencies & Technical Debt**
*Health of external dependencies and accumulated debt*
- Up-to-date dependencies
- Minimal dependency bloat
- Clear upgrade path
- Low coupling to external libraries
- Score 80+ = Minimal tech debt

### 10. **Scalability & Flexibility**
*Ability to grow and adapt to changing requirements*
- Modular architecture
- Configuration over hardcoding
- Horizontal scaling considerations
- Feature flags and toggles
- Score 80+ = Enterprise-ready scalability

## Refactoring Triggers
- Any category below 50: Immediate attention needed
- Average score below 60: Schedule refactoring sprint
- 2+ categories below 60: Major refactoring required
- Average 70+: Healthy codebase, minor improvements only

## Elegance/Sophistication Score (1-100)
*Measures how refined, thoughtful, and well-crafted the solution is*

**1-20**: Brute force solutions, works but inelegant
**21-40**: Basic implementation, follows patterns minimally
**41-60**: Solid craftsmanship, good abstractions
**61-80**: Elegant solutions, thoughtful design choices
**81-100**: Masterful implementation, innovative patterns

**Elegance indicators:**
- Simple solutions to complex problems
- Intuitive APIs and interfaces
- Beautiful abstractions that "feel right"
- Code that teaches best practices
- Solutions that anticipate future needs

**Note**: High elegance means the code is a joy to work with - it's not about being clever or complex, but about finding the simplest, most maintainable solution that scales well.
